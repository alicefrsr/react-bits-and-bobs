# Bits & Bobs

> A random collection of simple React components and mini-apps built in the
> process of learning how React works.

Playground to practice and experiment with: React basics, custom hooks,
useReducer, the Context API, React Router, CSS modules, Redux...
Work-in-progress. Keeping things simple to focus on how and why things work. Or
don't. Not everything is responsive. No back-end, no data persistence.
